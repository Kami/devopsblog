We believe in openness, passion, and collaboration. That's why one of our Core Values is Full Disclosure and Transparency. It's also the motivation behind our work in [OpenStack](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/openstack/) and the [Rackspace Private Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/private/). And it's the reason why Rackers are crazy innovative at building solutions that make a difference for our customers.

Our data centers contain servers, routers, and load balancers; but it’s developers who truly bring them to life. With skill, expertise, and talent, developers around the world transform visions of possibility into reality—revolutionizing how we work, communicate, and play.  The [Developer Community](https://community.rackspace.com/developers/default.aspx), part of the Rackspace Open Cloud Community, is now available to those who are passionate about building systems and writing code. Whether you want to discuss your latest project, ask questions about Rackspace APIs & SDKs, learn more about the Open Cloud, share your expertise, or find inspiration, the Developer Community is the place to connect, contribute, and be recognized. 

You don’t need to be a Rackspace customer to join! All we ask is that you bring your enthusiasm to collaborate with us and other passionate people around the globe who care about creating innovative solutions.  The Community, like the cloud, is now open and waiting for you to join the revolution. Visit the [Rackspace Open Cloud Community](https://community.rackspace.com/) today to play a part in the Developer Community.
